In the hills of northern California, lived a community that nobody realized 
still existed. It was so far north in California that it was basically Oregon, 
but nobody was entirely sure whether it actually crossed the California-Oregon 
border. Nobody outside of this community was entirely sure that it was still 
inhabited, so mostly, nobody cared if it actually crossed the 
California-Oregon border. In this community, lived a high school senior named 
Kelly, who was applying to both the University of Oregon and University of 
California. The problem was that neither heads of admissions knew whether to 
charge Kelly as an in-state student or an out-of-state student.

Befuddled by this confounding situation, two school boards gathered a meeting.
"Where do they belong?" one side asked. "Let's toss a coin, if head, then it's
California, vice versa." However, the coin landed on its side, render the situation undeterminable. 
Thwarted, everyone in the meeting are brainstroming to try to come up with new
methods to solve this conundrum. Somebody suggested a vote, but the result was
50/50, which, till, indeterminate. Unable to decide, the board leader announced
"Meeting's adjourned!"
